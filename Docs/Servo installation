# Servo installation and calibration
### Introduction
Servos have a defined center location and can be made to move some number of degrees in either direction away from Center.   We define "center" as where the output shaft goes when the servo sees a pulse width of 1500 microseconds.  Traditionally servos could move only 45 degrees away from center for a total rotation of 90 degrees.  But today most servos have a total rotation range of about 180 degrees or slightly less.  We must install the servo so that it's center is aligned closely with the robot part's midpoint in its range of motion and then the unavoidable error in alignment is measured and stored in a calibration file.   The procedure below explains how this is done.
### Procedure
To install a servo, first connect it to a servo tester or computer and "center" the servo by sending it a set of 1500 microsecond (same as 1.5 millisecond) pulses.  Then manually align the robot's parts the servo is to go into to their "center".  Hopefully this angle is marked on the robot or you have an assembly jig to align the parts.   In any case this alignment can never be perfect because the servo output spline has only 25 teeth and you have to select the closest fit.   The error can be as much as half a tooth or one part in 50.  Get it as close as you can and later we will fine tune the calibration in software.

Assemble the parts and tighten all the screws.  Use a servo tester or software to move the servo to it's center point.   You do this by getting the servo tester to send pulses that are exactly 1.5 milliseconds (or 1500 uSec) long.  This is the definition if "center".   Next we must measre the angle from whereever the part is to where it it should be.  This angle is the offset
