# Spot Micro Modular

*Please note that this repository is not yet populated.   Files are placed here as they are created*

This repository holds my version of “Spot Micro” which was originated by Thingiverse user “KDY0523”.  

### Motivation

There are many Spot Micro projects on the Internet.  They are all derived from the same KDY0523 original.  I wanted a project that could incorporate some of the best idea from other Spot Micro versions, plus some of my own ideas.  One of my main goals was to make a modifiable design.  I wanted modular and swapable parts.


The CAD files were all re-drawn, but retain the look and dimension of the original as much as possible. 

This Spot Micro uses a Raspberry Pi4 running Ubuntu Linux as the controller.  But the electronics are mounted to a tray and can be sapped out as a pre-wired unit, battery, power supplies, computer and all.

### How To Build

You can simply 3D print all the STL files and install the software on the Pi4 and you will in theory have a copy of my latest version.  Or, you can download or clone a related version from this repository and get file versions that should all work together.
