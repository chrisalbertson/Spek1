# Spek1

This repository holds my version of “Spot Micro” which was originated by Thingiverse user “KDY0523”. 

Why the name "Spek1"?  The work "Speck" means a small spot. and this robot is inspired by Boston Dynamic's "Spot", but this robot is much small.  It is a smaller Spot.    Then the leter "c" is removed.    The number "1" is added to imply that there coud be a series of these robots.

### Motivation

There are many Spot Micro projects on the Internet.  They are all derived from the same KDY0523 original.  I wanted a project that could incorporate some of the best ideas from other Spot Micro versions, plus some of my own ideas.  One of my main goals was to make a modifiable design.  I wanted modular and swapable parts.

The CAD files were all re-drawn, but retain the look and dimension of the original as much as possible. 

This Spot Micro uses a Raspberry Pi4 running Ubuntu Linux as the controller.  But the electronics are mounted to a tray and can be sapped out as a pre-wired unit, battery, power supplies, computer and all.

### How To Build

You can simply 3D print all the STL files and install the software on the Pi4 and you will in theory have a copy of my latest version.  Detailed instructions for doing this are in other documents in this repository.
